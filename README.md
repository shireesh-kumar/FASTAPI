# FastAPI Todo List Application

This project is a simple FastAPI application designed to store a todo list. While the functionality of the application is basic, the main goal of this project is to build a CI/CD pipeline and deploy the application to an AWS EC2 instance. 

## Features
- **FastAPI**: A simple and fast web framework for building APIs.
- **Dockerized**: The application is containerized using Docker, enabling easy deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: The pipeline automatically builds and pushes the new Docker image to Docker Hub on every code change (except for `README.md` changes) and deploys the image to an AWS EC2 instance.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (for Windows users): Docker Desktop needs to be running for Docker to work. For Linux systems, Docker runs natively as a service.
- **Docker Compose**: For running the application using Docker containers.

### Running the Application

### Running via Docker Compose

To run the application with Docker, use the following command to build the image and start the container for the first time:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
For later use, you can avoid the --build tag :iykyk

### Running via Uvicorn

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run the FastAPI app directly using Uvicorn.

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```

Note:
- In both Dockerized and local Uvicorn setups, the application will be available at http://localhost:8000 (HTTP, not HTTPS).
- HTTPS configuration requires additional setup and is not included here (to be implemented ðŸ˜Š).


### CI/CD Pipeline
Every time changes are pushed (except for the README.md file), the CI/CD pipeline is triggered. The pipeline performs the following tasks:

- Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the repository.
- Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub with the latest tag.
- Deployment on AWS EC2 : the image is pulled from Docker Hub to an AWS EC2 instance and run as a Docker container. The application will be available via HTTP at: http://<public-ipv4-ec2>:80


**Note for EC2 Deployment**: 

For those who want to try EC2 deployment, make the following changes in ci-cd.yml file at every occurances:

ubuntu@3.133.122.121 'sudo docker pull shireesh1998/fastapiserver:latest'
In the above command, replace 3.133.122.121 with your EC2 instance's public IPv4 address. Also, shireesh1998 is the Docker Hub username and fastapiserver is the Docker Hub repository name.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple FastAPI application with an integrated CI/CD pipeline using Docker and AWS EC2
